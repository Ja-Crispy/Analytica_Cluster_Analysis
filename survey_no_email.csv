Deciding where you will reside for a whole year and pay the fees just on the basis of whose site crashes and whose does not is utter  Non-sense by the administration. Personally, I was sitting an hour in advance but the site opened only after 40 mins leaving me with no other choice. On top of that, we had a compulsion to fill the ODS undertaking w/o which we won't be able to book further. Instead of improving their website, this issue is left as it is each year while the administration forces their cash-cow methods on our parent's hard earned money."
